title: Skupper Hello World with YAML
subtitle: A minimal HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper
github_actions_url: https://github.com/ssorj/skupper-example-yaml/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a variant of [Skupper Hello World][hello-world] that
  is deployed using YAML resource definitions instead of imperative
  commands.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
    (<pod-name>)`.

  * A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and
    fetches new greetings in response.

  Skupper enables you place the backend in one cluster and the
  frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two
  services without exposing the backend to the public internet.

    preamble: |
      To configure our example sites and service bindings, we are
      using the following resources:

      West:

      * [frontend.yml](west/frontend.yaml) - The Hello World frontend
      * [skupper.yaml](west/skupper.yaml) - The Skupper controller
      * [site.yaml](west/site.yaml) - Configuration for site `west`
      * [listener.yaml](west/listener.yaml) - The listener for the `backend` service

      East:

      * [backend.yaml](east/backend.yaml) - The Hello World backend
      * [skupper.yaml](east/skupper.yaml) - The Skupper controller
      * [site.yaml](east/site.yaml) - Configuration for site `east`
      * [connector.yaml](east/connector.yaml) - The connector for the `backend` service

      Let's look at some of these resources in more detail.

      #### Resources in west

      The `site` ConfigMap defines a Skupper site for its associated
      Kubernetes namespace.  This is where you set site configuration
      options.  See the [config reference][config] for more
      information.

      [config]: https://github.com/ssorj/refdog

      [site.yaml](west/site.yaml):

      ~~~ yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: skupper-site
        namespace: west
        labels:
          skupper.io/type: site
      data:
        name: west
      ~~~

      The Hello World example has a frontend workload in west that
      sends HTTP requests to a backend service.  To make that service
      available in west, create a `listener` resource with
      `routing-key: backend:http`.  Connections to the local listener
      are routed to connectors in remote sites with matching routing
      keys.  The `host` and `port` fields define the local connection
      endpoint.

      [listener.yaml](west/listener.yaml):

      ~~~ yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: skupper-listener-backend
        namespace: west
        labels:
          skupper.io/type: listener
      data:
        routing-key: backend:http
        host: backend
        port: 8080
      ~~~

      #### Resources in east

      Like the one for west, here is the Skupper site definition for
      the east namespace.  It includes the `ingress: none` setting
      since no ingress inquired at this site for the Hello World
      example.

      [site.yaml](east/site.yaml):

      ~~~ yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: skupper-site
        namespace: east
        labels:
          skupper.io/type: site
      data:
        name: east
        ingress: none
      ~~~

      We have the `listener` for the backend defined in west.  We need
      the corresponding `connector` in east.  Note that it has the
      same routing key as the backend `listener`.

      The `selector` field identifies the pods implementing the
      service.

      [connector.yaml](east/connector.yaml):

      ~~~ yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: skupper-connector-backend
        namespace: east
        labels:
          skupper.io/type: connector
      data:
        routing-key: backend:http
        selector: app=backend
        port: 8080
      ~~~

      Now we're ready to apply everything.  Use `kubectl apply`
      command with the resource definitions for each site.
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl apply -f west/frontend.yaml -f west/skupper.yaml -f west/site.yaml -f west/listener.yaml
          output: |
            namespace/west created
            deployment.apps/frontend created
            service/frontend created
            serviceaccount/skupper-site-controller created
            role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-site-controller created
            rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-site-controller created
            deployment.apps/skupper-site-controller created
            configmap/skupper-site created
        - await_external_ip: service/skupper
      east:
        - run: kubectl apply -f east/backend.yaml -f east/skupper.yaml -f east/site.yaml -f east/connector.yaml
          output: |
            namespace/east created
            deployment.apps/backend created
            serviceaccount/skupper-site-controller created
            role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-site-controller created
            rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/skupper-site-controller created
            deployment.apps/skupper-site-controller created
            configmap/skupper-site created
        - await: [deployment/skupper-site-controller, deployment/skupper-router]
        - run: skupper expose deployment/backend
          apply: test
  - standard: link_your_namespaces
    preamble: |
      You can configure sites and service bindings declaratively, but
      linking sites is different.  To create a link, you must have the
      authentication secret and connection details of the remote site.
      Since these cannot be known in advance, linking must be
      procedural.

      **Note:** There are several ways to automate the generation and
      distribution of tokens across sites, using for example Ansible,
      Backstage, or Vault.  See [Token distribution]() for more
      information.

      This example uses the Skupper command line tool to generate the
      secret token in west and create the link in east.

      To install the Skupper command:

      ~~~ shell
      curl https://skupper.io/install.sh | sh
      ~~~

      For more installation options, see [Installing
      Skupper][install].

      Once the command is installed, use `skupper token create` in
      west to generate the token.  Then, use `skupper link create` in
      east to create a link.
